# Self-Balancing Robot

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a self-balancing robot using a microcontroller, sensors, and motor control mechanisms. The robot adjusts its balance dynamically to stay upright, leveraging a feedback control system implemented with PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) control.

The repository is structured as a [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) project, facilitating streamlined development and deployment.

## Features
- Dynamic self-balancing using a feedback loop.
- Integration with an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for precise orientation sensing.
- Motor control for dynamic adjustments.
- Easy customization for additional features, such as remote control or obstacle detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Hardware Components:**
   - Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32-S3 or ESP32 family).
   - IMU sensor (e.g., MPU6050).
   - Motor driver module (e.g., L298N).
   - DC motors.
   - Battery and power management components.

2. **Software Tools:**
   - [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/).
   - Required libraries: [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/wire/), MPU6050 library.

### Setting Up the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Afnan-Yusuf/Balancing-robot.git
